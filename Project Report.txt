1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Project Title
Personalized Budget/Goal Forecaster

1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consumers frequently struggle with financial goal planning due to a lack of visibility into the long-term effects of their current spending habits or potential adjustments. Traditional budgeting tools track the past and present but do not effectively quantify how slight behavioral changes (e.g., saving an extra 50 per month) will impact the timeline for reaching a future financial target. This uncertainty often leads to poor decision-making and delayed goal achievement.

1.3 OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this project are:
  * To develop a working prototype.
  * To test its effectiveness.
  * To analyze the outcomes.

---------------------------------------------------

2.0 METHODOLOGY

The project was completed using the Agile methodology. Key tools used included:
  * Python programming language.
  * VS Code editor.
  * Git version control.

Data was collected via input by the user for various types like Current Savings, Monthly Income, Fixed Expenses, and Variable Expenses.
---------------------------------------------------

3.0 IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 Core Logic: Financial Modeling
The central calculation is determining the months needed to cover the shortfall.
The Monthly Surplus is calculated as:

Surplus =Income - (Fixed Expenses + Variable Expenses)

The Months Needed is calculated using the ceiling function:

Months = (Target-Current Savings)/Monthly Surplus

3.2 Data Structures
The project primarily relies on simple data types (float, int) for financial figures and the specialized datetime.date object for time-related calculations. No external databases or complex data structures were required.
---------------------------------------------------

4.0 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
After running the program
--Process Flow: 
1.Input: User enters financial variables (Savings, Income, Expenses, Target).
2.Baseline Calculation: The script calculates the initial surplus and the time-to-goal.
3.Scenario Input: User provides the amount they wish to change their monthly saving by.
4.Scenario Calculation: The script calculates the new surplus and the new time-to-goal.
5.Reporting: Results are compared, and the difference in the goal timeline is presented.
---------------------------------------------------

5.0 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

5.1 CONCLUSION
The project successfully achieved its primary objectives. The prototype is functional and demonstrated successfully.A key takeaway was the importance of the math.ceil() function in financial modeling to ensure a realistic completion month.

5.2 FUTURE WORK
->GUI Interface: Implement a graphical user interface using a library like Tkinter or PyQt                        to make the tool more accessible.

->Interest Modeling: Incorporate an annual interest rate and compound the savings monthly, providing a more realistic forecast.
